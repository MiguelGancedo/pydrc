# pydrc: Python Dose-Response Curves

![Python_project_logo](https://github.com/Mr-Mathias-F/pydrc/assets/74455376/d8f9cbdd-5566-4149-a1b6-dcc19a032ac3)

pydrc is a powerful Python package specially designed for the analysis and visualization of dose-response data in fields like toxicology, pharmacology, and environmental science. 

The package simplifies the process of implementing various dose-response models, offering a uniform interface for a wide range of common models, including but not limited to Hill, Logistic, Gompertz models, and more.

## Key Features
- **Wide Range of Models**: Implementation of a broad selection of dose-response models.
- **Robust Estimation**: Parameter estimation using state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Tools for the evaluation of model performance and selection.
- **Data Visualization**: Aesthetic and intuitive visualization of dose-response curves using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Flexibility**: Capability to handle user-defined models.

Built for the scientific community, pydrc bridges the gap between intricate dose-response analyses and Python's ease of use, empowering researchers to concentrate on interpreting results instead of wrestling with the coding of analyses.

Contributions are welcomed and appreciated as we aim to make pydrc the go-to resource for dose-response curve analysis in Python.
