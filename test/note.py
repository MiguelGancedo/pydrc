pydrc.model(df, x, y, function, group)

if group != None:
  for i in group:
    self.data[group]
    curve_fit()
    STORE PARAMETERS HERE (Sum error squared)

# Application: compound 'A' vs compound 'B'
  # model.fit() yields:
  # summary()
  # predict() based on grouping
  # plot() based on grouping
  # residual error (per individual model and across model by summation of squared error and dividing by residual DF)
